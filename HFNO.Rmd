> High flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) is increasingly regarded as a promising technology for oxygen delivery in critical care and anesthetic management. The 2018 guidelines from the American Society of Anesthesiology for procedural sedation stated that there is insufficient evidence regarding which methods of supplemental oxygen administration (e.g., nasal cannula, face mask, or specialized devices such as HFNO) are more effective. This trial will address this limitation in the evidence base specifically in regard to the efficacy of using HFNO during conscious sedation in the cardiac catheterisation laboratory.
