> How a nurse responds to sedation-induced respiratory depression may make the difference between a good or disastrous patient outcome. For this reason, implementing capnography into practice for respiratory monitoring during sedation is considered a high priority to improve patient safety by leading authorities including peak professional organisations for anaesthesia in Canada, the United States, Australia and Europe. A capnography waveform displays the level of expired carbon dioxide (CO~2~) over time to show changes in concentrations throughout the respiratory cycle. Capnography waveform abnormalities assist in the detection and diagnosis of specific conditions, such as partial airway obstruction and apnoea. Deciphering which capnography waveform abnormalities deserve nurses’ attention and intervention from those that do not is an essential step towards successful implementation of this technology into practice for nurse-administered sedation. Dr Conway has an on-going program of research aimed at addressing this goal.

## <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right fa-lg"></i>  [A systematic review of capnography for sedation](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/anae.13378)

This systematic review was published in a highly ranked journal in the field of Anesthesiology. Exemplifying the clinical importance of this publication, was an [editorial](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/anae.13387) written specifically to accompany my paper on the implementation of capnography into clinical practice. Professor Cook highlighted in his Editorial that the findings of our review are most relevant to the clinical situation of nurse-administered sedation (as compared with sedation administered by an anaesthetist). It was further emphasised that a definitive decision on how capnography can be used to improve patient safety during sedation will require “better designed and better conducted studies” (p.365). Dr Conway's current research sttempts address this particular evidence-practice gap regarding the implementation of capnography monitoring for nurse-administered sedation.

In this study we utilized an approach known as state sequence analysis to examine capnography waveform abnormalities throughout cardiology procedures performed with sedation and analgesia. Identifying common patterns in capnography waveform abnormalities and determining the demographic and clinical factors that influence these patterns could yield insights to optimize responses to respiratory depression in clinical practice.

Descriptive analysis of the respiratory state sequences clearly demonstrated that capnography waveform abnormalities are frequent and prolonged in this typical (mostly elder) population of patients undergoing cardiac procedures who received sedation with small bolus doses of midazolam and fentanyl. Applying a clustering algorithm to group similar respiratory state sequences revealed insights into common patterns of ventilatory responses to the medication used for procedural sedation.

## <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right fa-lg"></i>  Predictors of apnea

To further examine the associations between respiratory states, we used a Mixed effects Cox model, sometimes called a frailty model, to analyze the recurrent apneic events. The plot below illustrates how the risk of an apneic episode varies during the procedure for a patient in the sample. The HR at the beginning of the procedure  is 5.6 [4.2, 7.5] due to the random effect, indicating that this patient is innately at a higher risk for apnea when compared to others in the sample. The increase in HR due to additional sedation doses is apparent during the second episode of normal breathing – upon administration of additional sedative, the HR increases from 5.6 [4.2, 7.5] to 12.0 [7.3, 19.5] and the overall HR remains elevated throughout the rest of the procedure.
