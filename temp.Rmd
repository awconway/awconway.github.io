> Mild hypothermia (defined as temperature below 36°C) is considered an adverse effect of anaesthesia that should be avoided. Studies have shown that it increases post-operative complications and reduces patient satisfaction. Patients undergoing procedures in the cath lab are exposed to similar risks for perioperative hypotermia, including a low ambient room temperature and receiving medications that impair thermoregulation. Dr Conway's reearch in this area has revealed several significant findings.

## <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right fa-lg"></i> 1 in every 4 sedated patients met the accepted definition for mild hypothermia (<36.0°C) after their procedure.
