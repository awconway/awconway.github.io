The spiritR package contains an Rmarkdown template for a clinical trial protocol adhering to the [SPIRIT](http://www.spirit-statement.org/) checklist.

Contained within the template is a section for each of the elements that should be adressed in a clinical trial protocol. Links to the SPIRIT statement guidance about what should be addressed in each element are provided.

Functions in the spiritR package provide the functionality to  upload information from the protocol developed in your Rmardown file to a new record in the clinicaltrials.gov registry.
