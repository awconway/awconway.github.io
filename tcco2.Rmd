> It is vital that clinicians have a clear understanding of the accuracy of TcCO~2~ monitoring devices to ensure they are applied in appropriate circumstances. Our research has identified that there are substantial differences between TcCO~2~ and PaCO~2~ depending on the context in which this technology is used. TcCO~2~ sensors should preferentially be applied to the earlobe and users should consider setting the temperature of the sensor higher than 42Â°C when monitoring at other sites.
